This project exists to create reliable, high-quality software.
All interactions in GitHub issues, discussions, pull requests, chats, or any other project space must keep that goal in mind and remain professional.

## 2. Expected Behaviour
* Treat collaborators with courtesy and assume good intent.
* Give constructive feedback: be clear, specific, and respectfully honest—do not fear being critical, this is how we improve! 
* Keep discussions focused on code, architecture, docs, and project process.
* Respect decisions once they are reached—disagree, commit, and move on.
* Keep in mind that nnot all contributors are native English speakers.

## 3. Unacceptable Behaviour
The following are **never** appropriate in project spaces:
* Selling or just making public any of the code we create, unless agreed upon first by the full team.
* Personal attacks, name-calling, or insulting remarks.

* Sharing private or proprietary information without permission.
* Persistent off-topic conversation that derails technical work.

## 4. Reporting Problems

All reports are confidential. We will acknowledge receipt within two business days and aim to resolve the issue within one week.

Maintainers may, at their discretion:
1. Give a verbal or written warning.
2. Remove comments or code that violate this policy.
3. Temporarily or permanently ban an individual from project spaces.
